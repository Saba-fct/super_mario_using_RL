Super mario; This project uses the concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL).The RL method used in this case is Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO).The idea of RL is where agents learn to behave in an environment by performing certain actions and seeing their outcomes. Essentially the possible outcomes are if the agent performs a bad action they are punished and if they perform a good action they are rewarded. So in this case we focus on the 4 key components which are the agent, state, environment and reward. We can say that the agent is the mario character, the state is the position and direction of the mario character, the environment is the game and finally the reward is dependent on whether the mario character moves forward or not. If it does not move forward there will be NO reward but if it does move forward there WILL be a reward.
